# 555 Timer Audio Tone Generator

## 📌 Overview
This project is an audio tone generator circuit designed using KiCad 9.0.
It uses the LM555 timer IC in astable mode to produce a continuous tone
which is output through a speaker.

## 🔧 Functionality
- Generates an audible square wave using a 555 timer
- Speaker output through coupling capacitor
- Frequency determined by R1, R2, C1 network
